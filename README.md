# JavaScript DOM Manipulation and Dynamic Styling

This repository contains three assignments that demonstrate JavaScript's capability to manipulate HTML documents, handle form submissions, and dynamically style HTML elements based on user interactions.

3. [Styling with JavaScript](#styling-with-javascript)

## Document Manipulation with JavaScript

**Objective**: Enhance proficiency in manipulating HTML documents dynamically using JavaScript, focusing on the manipulation of arrays and objects to modify document content and structure.

### Tasks:

1. **Create an Array of Products**: 
   - An array of objects, each representing a product with its name, price, and description.

2. **Display Product Information**:
   - A JavaScript function to dynamically generate and display product information on the webpage.

3. **Event Listener**:
   - An event listener that triggers the display of products when the page loads.

### Files:
- `product.html`: The HTML structure for the product list page.
- `product-script.js`: JavaScript code to manipulate the product list and update the DOM.

## Form Manipulation with JavaScript

**Objective**: Practice manipulating HTML forms dynamically using JavaScript, focusing on handling arrays, objects, and form elements to capture user input and modify form behavior.

### Tasks:

1. **Create an HTML Form**:
   - A form with input fields for user's name, email, and message.

2. **Handle Form Submissions**:
   - JavaScript code to capture user input and store it in an object.

3. **Form Validation**:
   - Implement validation to ensure that all required fields are filled before submission.

### Files:
- `form.html`: The HTML structure for the contact form.
- `form-script.js`: JavaScript code to handle form submissions and validation.

## Styling with JavaScript

**Objective**: Practice manipulating CSS styles dynamically using JavaScript, applying various styling changes to HTML elements based on user interaction.

### Tasks:

1. **Create HTML Structure with Elements**:
   - An HTML structure with at least 5 elements that will be styled dynamically.

2. **Dynamic Styling with JavaScript**:
   - JavaScript code to change the color of elements and apply other styling changes based on user interactions.

### Files:
- `styling.html`: The HTML structure for demonstrating dynamic styling.
- `styling-script.js`: JavaScript code to apply dynamic styling to HTML elements.

## Usage

To view and test each assignment, open the corresponding HTML file in your web browser. Ensure that the JavaScript files are in the same directory as the HTML files, as they are linked directly.

### Example

To view the Document Manipulation assignment:
1. Open `product.html` in your web browser.
2. Observe the dynamically generated product list based on the JavaScript code in `product-script.js`.

## Conclusion

These assignments cover essential concepts in JavaScript DOM manipulation, form handling, and dynamic styling. By completing these tasks, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to interact with and modify web pages using JavaScript.
